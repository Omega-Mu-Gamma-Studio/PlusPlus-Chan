## What is PlusPlus-chan?

PlusPlus-chan is a browser-based C++ learning app where an anime mascot character guides students through a complete game-development-oriented C++ curriculum. Every lesson follows a fixed three-phase model — working code, broken code, then you try — with an expressive character who **reacts to your progress**, escalates her hints when you're stuck, and celebrates when you get it right.

The twist? Every single concept is taught through the lens of **building a game**. Variables aren't abstract — they're your player's health. Pointers aren't scary — they're your enemy's memory address. By the end of all 75 lessons, you've built a complete text-based RPG in C++, piece by piece.

No abstract theory walls. No cold segfaults. No account required. Just C++ and a very intense tutor.

---

## The Teaching Model

Every single lesson — all 75 of them — follows this exact structure:

| Phase | Name | What Happens |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **1** | See It Work | C++-chan shows working code, the output, and explains what's happening line by line |
| **2** | See It Break | Same code, deliberately broken — she explains the error, what caused it, and why it matters |
| **3** | You Try | Student writes code or fills in blanks; pattern-based validation gives immediate feedback |

Validation is regex/pattern-based — no code execution in the browser. For full programs, students compile and run in their own environment. This keeps the app lightweight and deployable anywhere.

### 🎨 The Shop

The shop has two sections — cosmetics that change the app itself, and downloadable wallpapers for your device.

**App Themes** (equippable backgrounds):

| Level | Item | Style |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Midnight Violet 🌌 | Cold, precise, and deeply purple — the default |
| 3 | Steel & Silver ⚙️ | Compiled, metallic, precise. The machine aesthetic |
| 5 | Indigo & Gold 👑 | Dark fantasy royalty. Deep indigo, gilded accents |
| 7 | Crimson Debug 🔴 | Blood on the compiler floor. For the fearless |
| 9 | Terminal Green 💻 | Classic hacker terminal. Green on black, forever |

**Character Outfits** (equippable; all with full 6-expression sprite art):

| Level | Outfit | Vibe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Classic Hoodie 🧡 | Her signature look, always equipped |
| 2 | Game Dev 🧥 | Game Dev Mode — ON |
| 4 | Competitive Programmer 🎀 | Winner Winner Chicken? Wait.. Wrong Game! |
| 6 | Memory Witch 🪄 | The Pointers Bend to her Will. Allegedly |
| 8 | Low Level Operative 🕶️ | Cold logic. Precise execution. Every register matters |
| 10 | Undefined Behaviour Queen 👘 | You survived Undefined Behaviour. Wear the Crown |

**Downloadable Wallpapers** (phone/desktop art, save to your device):

| Level | Wallpaper | Vibe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 3 | Compile Time 🌆 | The longest wait ends with two words |
| 5 | The Stack 🏰 | Every function leaves a footprint |
| 7 | Rainy Commute 🌧️ | Even after work... the code follows |
| 9 | Vacation Build 🌅 | Even the longest debug sessions end with a sunset |

### ✨ Character & Expressions

PlusPlus-chan has 6 distinct expressions that fire contextually throughout lessons:

| State | Trigger |
| --- | --- |
| `idle` | Phase 1 — explaining working code |
| `thinking` | Hint mode; waiting for input |
| `surprised` | Correct answer |
| `happy` | Phase transitions and encouragement |
| `sad` | Wrong answer (first few times) |
| `idle-sleep` | Idle between interactions |

Each equipped outfit has its own full set of 6 expression sprites — swapping outfits changes PlusPlus-chan's entire look, not just a filter.

**Domain Expansion** — a fullscreen celebration effect fires on milestone level-ups, complete with confetti.

## Coming Soon 🔒

The cosmetics system is built to grow. If the project gains traction, here's what's planned for future drops. These will appear as locked preview cards in the shop — you'll see them coming before they arrive.

### Outfits

| Outfit | Vibe | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Debug Mode 😴 | 14-hour coding session. Oversized shirt, messy hair, energy drink in hand | Early unlock — every programmer has been this person |
| Kunoichi 🥷 | Silent code. No warnings. No errors. Kunai shaped like a semicolon | Because C++ programmers already think they're doing something dangerous |
| Idol ✨ | Sparkly, chaotic, made for the Domain Expansion moment | She performs the celebration sequence — might as well dress for it |
| Professor 🥼 | Lab coat, round glasses, clipboard. She means business | Perfect energy for Unit 3 and 5 where she's truly bearing down |
| Out of Scope - Swimsuit 👾 | Out of scope. Out of office. Out of reach. | Secret unlock or prestige reward — details TBD |

### Downloadable Wallpapers

The current wallpaper set leans heavily dark and purple. Future drops will deliberately break that mould — same character, same signature colours, completely different worlds.

| Wallpaper | Location | Colour Palette | Mood |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cherry Blossom Courtyard 🌸 | Daytime Japan, sakura tree, petals falling | Soft pink, warm white, spring daylight | Her dark look against bright pink — the contrast is the point |
| Mountain Summit 🏔️ | Sunrise peak, sea of clouds below, wind in her hair | Gold, amber, pale blue sky | Cinematic. She made it to the top. So did you |
| Autumn Library 📚 | Cozy university library, amber lamplight, leaves outside | Oranges, warm brown, cream | The study-session wallpaper. Warm everything |
| Rooftop Garden 🌿 | Urban rooftop, city skyline, surrounded by plants | Bright green, sky blue, white sunlight | She's outside for once. The sign next to her says `// TODO: touch grass` |
| Neon Arcade 🕹️ | Old-school arcade, hot pink and yellow lighting | Hot pink, neon yellow, dark floor | Completely different neon palette from the rainy commute. One of the cabinets is running the RPG from the curriculum |
| Shrine Steps 🏮 | Japanese shrine at dawn, stone steps, lanterns, morning mist | Pale pink, soft orange, mist white, stone grey | The most serene wallpaper in the set. Earned late |

> The design rule for every future wallpaper: **she stays the same, the world changes.** Dark character + vivid or warm environment = the contrast does the work.

## Adding Content

### Adding a New Lesson

Lesson JSON files live at `src/data/lessons/unit{N}/{N}.{M}.json`. Each file follows this structure:

```json
{
  "id": "1.1",
  "title": "What is C++?",
  "xp": 10,
  "phases": [
    {
      "phase": 1,
      "title": "See It Work",
      "dialogue": "C++-chan's explanation text here",
      "code": "#include <iostream>\nint main() { ... }",
      "output": "Hello, Player!"
    },
    {
      "phase": 2,
      "title": "See It Break",
      "dialogue": "Here's what happens when...",
      "code": "#include <iostream>\nint main() { ... broken code ... }",
      "error": "error: expected ';' before '}'"
    },
    {
      "phase": 3,
      "title": "You Try",
      "dialogue": "Your turn!",
      "prompt": "What directive includes the standard I/O library in C++?",
      "answer": "#include <iostream>",
      "hint": "It starts with a # symbol.",
      "solution": "#include <iostream>"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Adding a New Outfit

1. Create a folder under `public/sprites/uniforms/<outfit-name>/`
2. Drop in 6 PNGs named: `teaching.png`, `idle.png`, `oops.png`, `thinking.png`, `frustrated.png`, `excited.png`
3. Add an entry to `src/data/shopItems.js` with `spriteOverrides` mapping each expression state to the correct file path
4. That's it — `PlusPlusChan.jsx` and `Shop.jsx` both read `spriteOverrides` automatically

### Developer Cheat Mode

In the Shop page, **triple-click the Shop title** to toggle the dev cheat:

- First triple-click → instantly sets XP to 9999 and level to 10 (unlocks everything)
- Second triple-click → resets XP and level back to 0 / 1

---

## Roadmap

### Phase 1 (Current) ✅

- All 75 lessons authored and published
- Full cosmetics system (5 outfits, 5 themes, 4 downloadable wallpapers)
- XP/leveling, shop, expressions, domain expansion
- localStorage persistence, no account required

### Phase 1.5 (Cosmetics Expansion — if project gains traction) 🔒

- 5 new outfits (Debug Mode, Kunoichi, Idol, Professor, Cyber Glitch)
- 6 new downloadable wallpapers with intentionally diverse locations and colour palettes
- Ghost/teaser cards in the shop for upcoming content
- Possible prestige unlock for completing all 75 lessons

### Phase 2 (Planned)

- PostgreSQL + Express API backend
- User accounts and cross-device sync
- Progress stored server-side (the store already has a `_resetForMigration` hook and storage adapter pattern ready for this)
- Instructor view: class-wide completion dashboards
- No frontend rewrite required — only the storage layer changes

## Credits & Assets

**Character Art**: PlusPlus-chan's sprites were generated using AI tools and hand-curated for expression consistency by [@albertofelix08](https://github.com/albertofelix08). All character designs are proprietary to Omega Mu Gamma Studio.

**Note**: As a free, open-source educational tool, we prioritized shipping a complete learning experience over commissioning custom art. If you're an artist interested in contributing official character designs, reach out — we'd love to collaborate.
