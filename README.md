## What is PlusPlus-chan?

PlusPlus-chan is a browser-based C++ learning app where an anime mascot character guides students through a complete game-development-oriented C++ curriculum. Every lesson follows a fixed three-phase model — working code, broken code, then you try — with an expressive character who **reacts to your progress**, escalates her hints when you're stuck, and celebrates when you get it right.

The twist? Every single concept is taught through the lens of **building a game**. Variables aren't abstract — they're your player's health. Pointers aren't scary — they're your enemy's memory address. By the end of all 75 lessons, you've built a complete text-based RPG in C++, piece by piece.

No abstract theory walls. No cold segfaults. No account required. Just C++ and a very intense tutor.

## The Teaching Model

Every single lesson — all 75 of them — follows this exact structure:

| Phase | Name | What Happens |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **1** | See It Work | C++-chan shows working code, the output, and explains what's happening line by line |
| **2** | See It Break | Same code, deliberately broken — she explains the error, what caused it, and why it matters |
| **3** | You Try | Student writes code or fills in blanks; pattern-based validation gives immediate feedback |

Validation is regex/pattern-based — no code execution in the browser. For full programs, students compile and run in their own environment. This keeps the app lightweight and deployable anywhere.

### 🎨 The Shop

The shop has two sections — cosmetics that change the app itself, and downloadable wallpapers for your device.

| Level | Item | Style |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Midnight Violet 🌌 | Cold, precise, and deeply purple — the default |
| 3 | Steel & Silver ⚙️ | Compiled, metallic, precise. The machine aesthetic |

| 7 | Kunoichi 🥷 | Silent code. No warnings. No errors. The kunai is shaped like a semicolon |
| 7 | Idol ✨ | She already performs a Celebration. Might as well dress for it |
| 8 | Low Level Operative 🕶️ | Cold logic. Precise execution. Every register matters |
| 8 | Professor 🥼 | Lab coat. Round glasses. Clipboard. She means it this time |
| 10 | Undefined Behaviour Queen 👘 | You survived Undefined Behaviour. Wear the Crown |
| 10 | Out of Scope 👾 | Out of scope. Out of office. Out of reach |

**Downloadable Wallpapers** (phone/desktop art, save to your device):

| Level | Wallpaper | Vibe |
| --- | --- | --- |

| 3 | Cherry Blossom Courtyard 🌸 | Petals falling. Effective Modern C++ open on her lap |
| 5 | The Stack 🏰 | Every function leaves a footprint |
| 5 | Mountain Summit 🏔️ | She made it to the top. The flag says `int main()`. So did you |
| 5 | Autumn Library 📚 | Amber lamplight. C++ textbooks. Leaves outside the window |
| 7 | Rainy Commute 🌧️ | Even after work... the code follows |
| 7 | Rooftop Garden 🌿 | City skyline. The sign reads `// TODO: touch grass` |
| 7 | Neon Arcade 🕹️ | Hot pink. Neon yellow. One of the cabinets is running the RPG from the curriculum |
| 9 | Shrine Steps 🏮 | Stone steps. Dawn lanterns. Morning mist. The most peaceful one in the set |
| 9 | Vacation Build 🌅 | Even the longest debug sessions end with a sunset |

### ✨ Character & Expressions

PlusPlus-chan has 6 distinct expressions that fire contextually throughout lessons:

| State | Trigger |
| --- | --- |
| `idle` | Phase 1 — explaining working code |
| `thinking` | Hint mode; waiting for input |
| `surprised` | Correct answer |
| `happy` | Phase transitions and encouragement |
| `sad` | Wrong answer (first few times) |
| `idle-sleep` | Idle between interactions |

Each equipped outfit has its own full set of 6 expression sprites — swapping outfits changes PlusPlus-chan's entire look, not just a filter.

**Domain Expansion** — a fullscreen celebration effect fires on milestone level-ups, complete with confetti.

## Adding Content

### Adding a New Lesson

Lesson JSON files live at `src/data/lessons/unit{N}/{N}.{M}.json`. Each file follows this structure:

```json
{
  "id": "1.1",
  "title": "What is C++?",
  "xp": 10,
  "phases": [
    {
      "phase": 1,
      "title": "See It Work",
      "dialogue": "C++-chan's explanation text here",
      "code": "#include <iostream>\nint main() { ... }",
      "output": "Hello, Player!"
    },
    {
      "phase": 2,
      "title": "See It Break",
      "dialogue": "Here's what happens when...",
      "code": "#include <iostream>\nint main() { ... broken code ... }",
      "error": "error: expected ';' before '}'"
    },
    {
      "phase": 3,
      "title": "You Try",
      "dialogue": "Your turn!",
      "prompt": "What directive includes the standard I/O library in C++?",
      "answer": "#include <iostream>",
      "hint": "It starts with a # symbol.",
      "solution": "#include <iostream>"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Adding a New Outfit

1. Create a folder under `public/sprites/uniforms/<outfit-name>/`
2. Drop in 6 PNGs named: `teaching.png`, `idle.png`, `oops.png`, `thinking.png`, `frustrated.png`, `excited.png`
3. Add an entry to `src/data/shopItems.js` with `spriteOverrides` mapping each expression state to the correct file path
4. That's it — `PlusPlusChan.jsx` and `Shop.jsx` both read `spriteOverrides` automatically

### Developer Cheat Mode

In the Shop page, **triple-click the Shop title** to toggle the dev cheat:

- First triple-click → instantly sets XP to 9999 and level to 10 (unlocks everything)
- Second triple-click → resets XP and level back to 0 / 1

---

## Roadmap

### Phase 1 (Current) ✅

- All 75 lessons authored and published
- Full cosmetics system (11 outfits, 5 themes, 10 downloadable wallpapers)
- XP/leveling, shop, expressions, domain expansion
- localStorage persistence, no account required

### Phase 2 (Planned)

- PostgreSQL + Express API backend
- User accounts and cross-device sync
- Progress stored server-side (the store already has a `_resetForMigration` hook and storage adapter pattern ready for this)
- Instructor view: class-wide completion dashboards
- No frontend rewrite required — only the storage layer changes

## Credits & Assets

**Character Art**: PlusPlus-chan's sprites were generated using AI tools and hand-curated for expression consistency by [@albertofelix08](https://github.com/albertofelix08). All character designs are proprietary to Omega Mu Gamma Studio.

**Note**: As a free, open-source educational tool, we prioritized shipping a complete learning experience over commissioning custom art. If you're an artist interested in contributing official character designs, reach out — we'd love to collaborate.
